  "description": "An examination of U.S. empire and its narrative of “giving freedom” through war and refugee rescue. Nguyen focuses on Vietnamese refugees to the United States, unpacking how the U.S. represents itself as a benevolent savior granting them the “gift” of freedom. She argues that this gift actually comes with strings attached: refugees are expected to show gratitude and become model citizens, effectively indebting them to the nation. The book connects the dots between the military intervention in Southeast Asia, the refugee experience, and neoliberal ideas of debt and obligation. Nguyen’s critique reveals how humanitarian gestures can mask and perpetuate imperial power."
