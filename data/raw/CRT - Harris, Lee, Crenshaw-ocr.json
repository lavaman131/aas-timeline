  "author": "Cheryl I. Harris; Robert G. Lee; Kimberl√© Crenshaw",
  "year": 1993,
  "type": "article",
  "description": "A set of foundational essays in critical race theory by multiple authors. Harris's piece (e.g. 'Whiteness as Property') argues that whiteness functions as a valuable property right in American law, Lee's work examines racialization of Asian Americans in U.S. culture, and Crenshaw's landmark essay on intersectionality analyzes how race and gender intersect in the oppression of women of color. Together, these writings (from the early 1990s) illuminate how race is a social construct embedded in legal and social systems, and they helped form the intellectual backbone of Critical Race Theory."
