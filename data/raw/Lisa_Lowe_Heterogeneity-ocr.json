  "description": "A influential essay that challenges any single definition of “Asian American.” Lowe argues that Asian American identity should be understood as internally diverse (heterogeneous), formed through mixtures (hybridity), and not reducible to a unified whole (multiplicity). Pushing back against earlier attempts to define a monolithic Asian American experience, she emphasizes differences of ethnicity, gender, class, and history within Asian America. This theoretical piece, later included in Lowe’s book Immigrant Acts, helped shift the discourse toward recognizing complexity and contradiction in Asian American cultural politics."
