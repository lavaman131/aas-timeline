  "description": "A reflective essay on how wars do not simply end, but continue to shape lives in their aftermath. Sharif juxtaposes the ongoing struggles in Palestine and Afghanistan, examining how these conflicts persist as “non-endings” that haunt survivors and diasporic communities. She discusses the enduring effects of war—trauma, occupation, militarization—that linger long after official combat has ceased, calling attention to the shared experiences of Palestinians and Afghans living in the shadow of endless war."
