  "description": "In the introduction to Surface Relations, Huang lays out how the notion of Asian 'inscrutability' (appearing emotionless or unreadable) has been imposed on Asian/American subjects and how it can be reinterpreted. She explains that Asian American artists and performers have strategically used inscrutability — staying on the surface, refusing to reveal everything — as a queer and artistic tactic. This approach turns a racist cliché into a creative force, allowing artists to control their representation. The intro frames the book's exploration of various media (performance art, visual art, literature) where opacity and ambiguity become tools to question the demand for minorities to make themselves transparent or easily understood."
