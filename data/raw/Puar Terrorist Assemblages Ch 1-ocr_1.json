  "description": "A pathbreaking queer theory text that introduces the concept of homonationalism. Puar argues that sexuality, race, gender, and nation have realigned such that some LGBTQ subjects are now embraced by nationalist and pro-war agendas. The book shows how the US and other Western nations include certain queer individuals (portrayed as modern and worthy of protection) into the nation, in order to contrast them with a racialized 'terrorist' other. This inclusion of gay and lesbian rights within nationalism comes at the expense of “Orientalized” populations, demonstrating how even queer acceptance can reinforce imperialism and racism."
