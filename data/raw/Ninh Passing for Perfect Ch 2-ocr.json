  "description": "A study of the extreme pressures of the “model minority” myth on Asian American youth. Ninh investigates real cases of Asian Americans who pretended to be perfect students (such as faking college enrollment or academic success) and even resorted to crime to hide their failures. She argues that being a “model minority” is not simply a myth but an identity built on internalized pressures and aspirations, with devastating costs. The book differentiates between deliberate con artists and those who feel unable to stop “passing” as the ideal student, examining the toll of perfectionism imposed by immigrant success narratives."
