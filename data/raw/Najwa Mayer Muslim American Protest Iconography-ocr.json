  "description": "An analysis of the iconic imagery of Muslim American women in contemporary protests. Mayer focuses on the famous 2017 poster of a Muslim American woman wearing a U.S. flag hijab, tracing how this image was produced, altered, and circulated. She examines the intersections of race, gender, and secularism in this 'protest iconography,' discussing how the Muslim female figure is represented and contested in liberal dissent, and what these representations mean for American national belonging."
