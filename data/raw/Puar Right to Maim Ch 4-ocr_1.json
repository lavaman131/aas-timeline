  "description": "A theoretical analysis of how state power uses bodily injury as a tool of control. In this work, Puar argues that governments exercise a 'right to maim' - deliberately causing debility in certain populations rather than outright killing - as a means of regulating and dominating them. Using examples like Israel's policies toward Palestinians, she links disability studies with biopolitics, showing how the production of debility (permanent injury, economic and social incapacitation) is used to manage marginalized communities and reinforce hierarchies of race, gender, and empire."
