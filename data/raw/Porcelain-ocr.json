  "description": "A one-act stage play centered on a gay Chinese-British man who commits a crime of passion. Porcelain follows a Chinese teenager in East London who is found with the body of his white lover in a public restroom. . Through the ensuing investigation and monologues, the play explores themes of love, obsession, and the loneliness of being an outsider. Yew has noted that the work is not simply about racism or homophobia, but about intimacy and “being different,” a universal story of alienation and desire."
