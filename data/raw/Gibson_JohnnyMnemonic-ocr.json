  "description": "A seminal cyberpunk short story about a data courier who stores sensitive information in his brain. Johnny, a hustler in a high-tech underground future, has a cybernetic implant that allows him to smuggle data, but when he takes on a gig that overloads his memory, he finds himself hunted by the Yakuza. With the help of a heavily augmented bodyguard (and even a cybernetic dolphin), Johnny fights to survive. The story showcases Gibson's dystopian future of virtual information and street tech, and it paved the way for his later novel Neuromancer with its gritty portrayal of hackers, hitmen, and digital secrets."
