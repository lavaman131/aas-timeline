  "description": "A short story about protest, sacrifice, and the personal toll of political injustice. It follows an Afghan American college student in California who starves himself as a hunger strike against Israeli violence in Palestine. As 'Hungry Ricky Daddy' (the nickname he earns) pushes his body to its limits, the story explores themes of diaspora identity, empathy across borders, and the impact of global conflicts on individual lives. Kochaiâ€™s tale is poignant and politically charged, illuminating how a distant struggle can become intensely personal."
