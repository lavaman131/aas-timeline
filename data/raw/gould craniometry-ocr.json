  "title": "American Polygeny and Craniometry: The Origins of the American School of Anthropology",
  "author": "Stephen Jay Gould",
  "year": 1981,
  "type": "article",
  "description": "A critical historical analysis of 19th-century racial science and skull measurement. Gould examines how scientists like Samuel Morton collected and compared human skulls to rank races, revealing the biased methods and assumptions that underpinned these craniometric studies. This work (from Gould's The Mismeasure of Man) exposes how racial prejudices were cloaked as objective science in early American anthropology."
