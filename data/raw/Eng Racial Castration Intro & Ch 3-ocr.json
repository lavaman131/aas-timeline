  "description": "A scholarly analysis of how Asian American men have been culturally depicted and psychologically affected by emasculation. Eng uses the term “racial castration” to describe the process by which Asian American masculinity is feminized or rendered impotent in dominant U.S. narratives. Through readings of literature, film, and psychoanalytic theory, the book examines stereotypes like the desexualized Asian male or the feminized Asian queer, and shows how these images are tied to histories of war and exclusion. Eng's work challenges us to understand Asian American male identity beyond the tropes of powerlessness and to see how these racialized gender norms are constructed and can be resisted."
