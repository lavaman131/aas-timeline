  "description": "A critical essay calling for a rethinking of Asian American studies beyond U.S.-centric national frameworks. Writing in the mid-1990s, Wong observes that Asian American cultural criticism was at a “theoretical crossroads,” and she urges a “denationalized” approach that accounts for diaspora, transnational ties, and the multiplicity of Asian American experiences. She critiques earlier Asian American literary debates for being too narrowly focused on nation-bound identity politics and argues that globalization and immigration trends demand new methods that transcend national borders. This essay helped push the field toward more global and intersectional analyses of Asian American culture."
