  "description": "A groundbreaking collection of poetry and prose by an Asian American feminist poet. Mirikitani's work in Awake in the River is fierce and unapologetic, confronting sexual violence, anti-Asian racism, and the trauma of Japanese American incarceration. Through brash and politically outspoken poems, she emphasizes the power of awakening from silence and fighting for justice, embodying a singular voice that advances women-of-color feminism and global anti-imperialist solidarity."
