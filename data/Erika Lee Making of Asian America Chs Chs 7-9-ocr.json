  "description": "A comprehensive history of Asian Americans from the late 19th century through the 20th and 21st centuries. In these middle chapters, Lee covers pivotal events such as the fight against Asian exclusion laws, the experiences of Asian Americans during World War II (e.g. Japanese American incarceration), and the changes brought by the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act which opened the doors to new Asian immigration. She also discusses the Vietnam War and refugee waves in chapters 7â€“9, illustrating how Asian America was shaped by Cold War geopolitics. Throughout, Lee emphasizes the resilience of Asian American communities and their contributions to U.S. society, even as they faced racism and evolving stereotypes."
