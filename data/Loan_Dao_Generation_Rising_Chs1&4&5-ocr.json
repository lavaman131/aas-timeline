  "description": "An ethnographic study of a new generation of Southeast Asian American youth activism. Dao traces the development of Providence Youth Student Movement (PrYSM), a queer, Southeast Asian youth-led organization in Providence, RI . She explores how young Southeast Asian American activists form collective identities, build intergenerational coalitions, and create their own movement culture while navigating pressures from community elders and funders. The book highlights the challenges and growth of these youth organizers as they fight for social justice on their own terms."
