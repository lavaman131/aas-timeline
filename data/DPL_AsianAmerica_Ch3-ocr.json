  "description": "A critical exploration of the idea of “Asian/America” at the crossroads of the Asian and American. Palumbo-Liu discusses how Asian Americans have historically been positioned on a “racial frontier” – neither fully inside nor outside the nation. Chapter 3 of this book delves into the cultural and political dynamics of a specific era (the context suggests it may be about the late 20th century) when globalization and transnational flows became more pronounced. The author examines literature and events that reveal the tensions between embracing an American national identity and maintaining trans-Pacific connections. Overall, the book argues that Asian American identity is formed through movements across geographical, racial, and cultural boundaries, challenging the fixed notion of nationhood."
