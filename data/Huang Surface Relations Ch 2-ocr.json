  "description": "A scholarly work analyzing the concept of inscrutability as both a stereotype and an artistic strategy. Huang traces how Asian and Asian American artists have taken the longstanding stereotype of the “inscrutable Oriental” - the idea that Asian faces or feelings are unreadable - and turned it into a deliberate performance or aesthetic. In Chapter 2, she likely focuses on a particular case study (for instance, a performance artist or a film) to show how playing with surface, opacity, and silence can be a queer form of expression. By embracing ambiguity and unreadability, these artists challenge audiences' desire to “know” or stereotype Asians, thereby subverting power dynamics. The book as a whole proposes that surface is not shallow at all, but a meaningful site of resisting racial and gender legibility."
