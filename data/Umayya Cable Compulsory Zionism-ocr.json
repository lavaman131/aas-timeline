  "description": "A short scholarly essay that traces the origin and usage of the term 'compulsory Zionism.' Cable examines how, especially in American contexts, there is often an implicit expectation or pressure to accept Zionism (support for the Israeli state) as a normative stance, and she explores how this has been critiqued by scholars and activists. By outlining the genealogy of the concept, she highlights the contradictions in demanding ideological conformity on Israel-Palestine. The piece also considers how this enforced stance affects Palestinians — rendering their very existence and narratives as politically contentious — and it situates the discussion in broader Arab American solidarity politics."
