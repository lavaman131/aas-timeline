  "description": "A foundational text in sociology that proposes a theory of race as a socially constructed process. Omi and Winant define race as neither biologically real nor purely illusion, but as “a very real social classification” shaped by history and power relations. They introduce racial formation as the process by which social, economic, and political forces create and transform racial categories. Chapter 4 (in early editions) further examines how U.S. institutions (“the racial state”) and social movements continually interact to remake racial meanings over time, illustrating race's role in structuring society."
