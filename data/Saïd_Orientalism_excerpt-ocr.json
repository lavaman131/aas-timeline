  "description": "Edward Said's seminal work examining how the Western world has historically imagined and depicted 'the East.' Orientalism argues that European scholars, writers, and colonial administrators constructed the Orient (the Middle East, North Africa, and Asia) as an exotic, inferior opposite to the West, a discourse that justified colonial domination. Said details how this 'Orientalist' framework portrays Eastern cultures as unchanging, mysterious, and irrational, and how these stereotypes have real political power. This groundbreaking book essentially founded postcolonial studies by revealing the deep ties between knowledge and imperial power in Western representations of Asian and Arab peoples."
