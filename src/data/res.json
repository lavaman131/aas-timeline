    "year": 1993,
    "type": "article",
    "description": "A set of foundational essays in critical race theory by multiple authors. Harris's piece (e.g. 'Whiteness as Property') argues that whiteness functions as a valuable property right in American law, Lee's work examines racialization of Asian Americans in U.S. culture, and Crenshaw's landmark essay on intersectionality analyzes how race and gender intersect in the oppression of women of color. Together, these writings (from the early 1990s) illuminate how race is a social construct embedded in legal and social systems, and they helped form the intellectual backbone of Critical Race Theory.",

Chapter 3 of this book delves into the cultural and political dynamics of a specific era (the context suggests it may be about the late 20th century) when globalization and transnational flows became more pronounced. The author examines literature and events that reveal the tensions between embracing an American national identity and maintaining trans-Pacific connections. Overall, the book argues that Asian American identity is formed through movements across geographical, racial, and cultural boundaries, challenging the fixed notion of nationhood.",

Eng uses the term \u201cracial castration\u201d to describe the process by which Asian American masculinity is feminized or rendered impotent in dominant U.S. narratives. Through readings of literature, film, and psychoanalytic theory, the book examines stereotypes like the desexualized Asian male or the feminized Asian queer, and shows how these images are tied to histories of war and exclusion. Eng's work challenges us to understand Asian American male identity beyond the tropes of powerlessness and to see how these racialized gender norms are constructed and can be resisted.",

In Chapter 2, she likely focuses on a particular case study (for instance, a performance artist or a film) to show how playing with surface, opacity, and silence can be a queer form of expression. By embracing ambiguity and unreadability, these artists challenge audiences' desire to \u201cknow\u201d or stereotype Asians, thereby subverting power dynamics. The book as a whole proposes that surface is not shallow at all, but a meaningful site of resisting racial and gender legibility.",

He points out that an overemphasis on resistance might ignore cases where writers express ambivalence or critique their own communities. By the end, Nguyen advocates for a literary analysis that sees Asian American authors as artists and intellectuals engaging with American culture in varied ways, rather than as automatic revolutionaries.",

This approach turns a racist clich\u00e9 into a creative force, allowing artists to control their representation. The intro frames the book's exploration of various media (performance art, visual art, literature) where opacity and ambiguity become tools to question the demand for minorities to make themselves transparent or easily understood.",

    "description": "A critical historical analysis of 19th-century racial science and skull measurement. Gould examines how scientists like Samuel Morton collected and compared human skulls to rank races, revealing the biased methods and assumptions that underpinned these craniometric studies. This work (from Gould's The Mismeasure of Man) exposes how racial prejudices were cloaked as objective science in early American anthropology.",
